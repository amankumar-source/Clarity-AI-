/*
  App.css — intentionally empty.

  This file previously contained Vite scaffold boilerplate (`.logo`, `.card`,
  `#root` padding, `logo-spin` keyframes) that was never used by the actual
  application components. Keeping dead CSS increases bundle size and confuses
  Tailwind's purge pass.

  All application styles are handled by:
    - index.css  (global base + custom utilities)
    - Tailwind utility classes in JSX (co-located, tree-shaken automatically)
